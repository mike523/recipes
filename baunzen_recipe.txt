Recipie: Baunzen (German Traditional Recipe)

Ingredients:
 - 1 pound of potatoes
 - 2 eggs
 - 1 teaspoon salt
 - 200 gr. wheat flour
 - sunflower oil

Directions:
 1. Put the potatoes in a pressure cooker and boil them.
    On my system the boiling time starts when I see 2 red rings
    and then it takes 14 minutes.
    Cool down the pressure cooker with cold water, make sure there is no
    no pressure left and open it. Peel the potatoes.

    Alternatively peel them and boil them in water unless they are soft.

 2. smash the potatoes (I am using a potato ricer for this)

 3. Mix the smashed potatoes with the 2 eggs and the flour and the salt

 4. put the sunflower oil into a pan and heat it up

 5. in the meantime (while the oil is heating up) do the following
    take a handful of the mixed potatoe dough
    poor some flour on a wooden board
    roll out the potatoe dough on the wooden board and make roles that 
    are roughly as thick as your ring finger and about 10-15 cm long (so that the fit in your pan)

    Those roles are called Baunzen

6. once the oil in the pan is hot put the Baunzen in the pan and roast them gently on both sides 
   so that they are medium brown (takes about 2 min on medium heat)

7. serve the Bauzen e.g. with Cabbage (Sauerkraut) cooked in whine and smoked pork chop.
